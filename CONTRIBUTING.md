# Contributing

This is a community-maintained list of events -- it is inherently biased and incomplete.
However, we would like it to be as unbiased and complete as possible, so please help us by making contributions.
This file describes how we would like people to contribute, and what kind of contributions
are most helpful.

## Kinds of contributions

We welcome the following types of contributions, in the following ways:

Kind of contribution | What you can do | How you should do it
---------------------|-----------------|---------------------
**Missing events or event series** | Do you know of an event or event series that we do not have in our list? We would like to hear about it and keep it in our list | Open an "New Event" issue to request inclusion, then send a pull request
**Incorrect information** | Have you found an error or missing information in the events we already have? Help us keep the content clean and correct | Open a "Update Info" issue describing the problem, then send a pull request
**Formatting and Maintenance** | Do you know of a "better" way of maintaining this information? Do you want to make a website for it? Do you want to write a FAQ or info page? We would love to discuss that. | Open an issue to discuss the topic
**Community-building** | Do you have ideas about how the community itself could be enhanced and supported? We'd love to discuss that. | Open an issue to discuss the topic

Just so we're clear, we also are not interested in the following kinds of contributions:

- **Events out of scope**: We're sure we'll receive events that are outside our scope. Please don't be offended if we reject a contribution that doesn't fit our mission.
- **Abuse**: As always, be nice. If your contribution is not immediately accepted, please take a moment to remember that this is a purely volunteer effort. Any form of abuse or antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.  Spamming or self-serving promotion will also not be welcomed.
